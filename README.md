Attendance taking web app.

This is a ReasonReact rewrite of my prior [attendance](https://github.com/deciduously/attendance) Reagent project.  As much as I love working with Clojure, I was spending more time with the tooling I felt was reasonable while porting that to re-frame and adding functionality.  Same goes for Rocket - great to work with, but nightly rust was a hassle.  It turns out actix is great, anyhow.

So, of course, I hopped ship to something else new and niche.  Let's see how this goes.
